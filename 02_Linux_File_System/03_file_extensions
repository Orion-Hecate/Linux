File extensions in Linux
	- Now even if we say for example change the extension of a .png file to .jpg file it still
	works. But when we use the file command on that file even after changing the extension, it
	will give the file type as -> PNG image data. This is because every file has a header at the
	starting in the file which stores the type information for that file.

	- Now for another example, we have a text file. If we change the extension of it to pdf and
	opens it using the GUI, it will give the error. Since the GUI will see the extension of the
	file as the pdf and open the file in a pdf-viewer but in real the file is a text file, so
	a pdf-viewer cannot read it. This is because the Linux knows the real file extension but
	other softwares installed in Linux for GUI purposes do not know that and need a specific
	file extension to open corresponding files.
