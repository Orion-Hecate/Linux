	till 1 level deep in the hierarchical file system.

	hierarchical end.

		find . -name file_name

	current working directory in the hierachical order till end.

		find . -iname file_name
	It searches in a case-insensitive manner.

		find . -size +10k
	The above code will find for the files or directories with the size greater than the 10k in
	the hierarchical depth till end.

		find . -size -10k
	The above code will find for the files or directories with the size less than the 10k in
	the hierarchical depth till end.

		find . -size -10k -type f | wc -l
	The above code will give the files less than 10k and pass it to the wc command which will
	then give the count of line we get as an output from the find command.

		find . -size +10k -size -100k
	The above code will give the files or directories with a size more than 10k and less than
	100k in the hierarchical depth till end.

		find . -type f -size -10k -o -size +100k | wc -l
	The above code will give the count of files that are either less than 10k or greater than
	100k in the hierarchical depth till end because of the o option.
