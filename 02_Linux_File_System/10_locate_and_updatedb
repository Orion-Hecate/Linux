locate Command
	- We will give a patter to search to the locate command and it will search the whole database
	to find the files matching that pattern.

	- Example:
		locate *.conf
	The above code gives all the files ending with .conf
		
		locate -c *.conf
	The above code give only the count of all the files ending with .conf

		locate -i *.CONF
	The above code uses the ignore-case option, since by default locate is case sensitive.

		locate -l 3 *.conf
	The above code uses the limit option, to limit the search to first 3 matches.

		locate -S
	The above code gives the statistics of the database, i.e., the number of directories, files,
	bytes in file names and bytes used to store database along with the path to the database
	file.
	
		locate -L *.conf
	This checks that if there are any symbolic links, they arrive somewhere and are not just
	dangling before reporting them back.

		locate -e *.conf
	This prints only the files that are present at the time locate is run.



updatedb Command
	- used to update the database.

	- it uses elevated administrative privileges to run.
	
	- Examples:
		touch findme.txt
		updatedb
		locate findMe.txt
	The above code first creates the file, then update the database and then locate the file.
