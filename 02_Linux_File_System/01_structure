Structure of the Linux File System
	- The entire linux file system follows a tree structure.
	
	- top: / (root directory or folder)
	- in root: bin, boot, dev, etc, home, media, lib, mnt, root, usr, var, ...
	- in home: user1, user2, ...
	- in user: Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures, Public, Templates, Videos, ...

	- Anything inside a user's folder is specific to that user while anything above that folder
	affects the whole system or the root folder.

	- So special files required for the system are placed in the root folder and in order to
	access them or to change them we required the root access (or root password, i.e., elevated
	privileges).



Root directory contents
	- /		The very top (root) of the file tree. Holds everything else.
	- /bin		Stores common user linux command binaries.
	- /boot		Bootable linux kernel ad bootloader config files.
	- /dev		Files representing devices, tty (teletype) = terminal, fp = floppydisk,
			sd or hd = harddisks, ram = RAM
