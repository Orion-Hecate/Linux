Structure of the Linux File System
	- The entire linux file system follows a tree structure.
	
	- top: / (root directory or folder)
	- in root: bin, boot, dev, etc, home, media, lib, mnt, root, usr, var, ...
	- in home: user1, user2, ...
	- in user: Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures, Public, Templates, Videos, ...

	- Anything inside a user's folder is specific to that user while anything above that folder
	affects the whole system or the root folder.

	- So special files required for the system are placed in the root folder and in order to
	access them or to change them we required the root access (or root password, i.e., elevated
	privileges).



Root directory contents
	- /		The very top (root) of the file tree. Holds everything else.
	- /bin		Stores common user linux command binaries.
	- /boot		Bootable linux kernel ad bootloader config files.
	- /dev		Files representing devices, tty (teletype) = terminal, fp = floppydisk,
			sd or hd = harddisks, ram = RAM, cd = CD-ROM
	- /etc		Administrative configuration files. The format for many of these
			configuration can be found in section 5 of the Linux manual.
	- /home		Where the home directories for regular user are stored.
	- /media	Unlike /dev, /media is usually where removable media (USB sticks, external
			hard drives, etc.) are mounted.
	- /lib		Contains shared libraries needed by applications in /bin and /sbin to boot
			the system.
	- /mnt		A place to mount external devices. This can still be used but has been
			superseded by /media.
	- /misc		A directory used to sometime automount filesystems on request.
	- /opt		Directory Structure used to store additional (i.e., optional) software.
	- /proc		Information about system resources.
	- /root		The home folder for the root user a.k.a the superuser
	- /sbin		Contains administrative commands (binaries) for the root (super) user.
	- /tmp		Contains temporary files used by running applications/
	- /usr		Contains files pertaining to users that in theory don't change after
			installation.
	- /var		Contains directories of variable data that could be used by various
			applications. System log files, are usually found here.
