Wildcards
	- A wildcard in Linux is a symbol or a set of symbols that stands in for other characters.
	It can be used to substitute for any other character or characters in a string.
	For example, you can use a wildcard to get a list of all files in a directory that begin with
	the letter O.

	- It is used to make regular expression on based on which can generalize the type of data we
	want to work on.


	- Regular Expressions
		- A regular expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.
		Usually such patterns are used by string searching algorithms.
		
		- Since in regular expression * shows the zero or more occurences, i.e., we can have
		any string even the empty one in place of it.

		- Similar to * is the ? wilcard which matches for any string but is used for zero or
		one occurence, though in linux it denotes for one occurence.

		- [] wildcard is similar to ? as it only matches one place, but instead of matching
		any string or character it matches the regular expression passed inside of those
		square brackets.


	- Examples:
		ls Documents Downloads Desktop -> ls D*
	Instead of typing every folder name that starts with a D we can just write D* which gives us
	all the Directories having the first letter as D.
		
		ls Do*
	Instead of giving all the folders starting from D it give us now all the folders starting
	from the Do i.e., Documents and Downloads in general home directory case.

		ls ?.txt
	This will give a file that is .txt file with a name length of only 1 charcter.
	
		ls file[0-9].txt
	This will give a file that is named as file followed by one number from any 0-9 series
	followed by .txt extension.
	
		ls file[0-9]*.txt
	This will give a file that is names as file followed by zero or more numbers from any 0-9
	series followed by .txt extension.


	- This method of finding file names with the help of wildcards is called as globbing.
