rm Command
	- It is used to remove files (or directories).

	- Example:
		rm file_path ...
	The above code will delete the files(s) that are specified in front of rm.

	Suppose we have the files, file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt, file4.png and we want to delete
	all the txt files, then following code can be used:
		rm *.txt
	Also in our case we can use the following code:
		rm file{1..3}.txt

	In case we have other txt files named orion1.txt, orion2.txt, orion3.txt, then in order to
	delete the above mentioned files we can use the following code:
		rm file*.txt

	Suppose from the above mentioned 3 orion files and 3 other files we want to delete the files
	having 2 and 3 in it. So the following code will be used for that:
		rm *[2,3]*



	- Now we can remove a Directory also, using the following command: 
		rm -r
		
		- In this the r option is the recursive option, which removes all the files and
		folders.

		- Example:
			rm -r dir_path
		The above code will delete the directory as specified in the dir_path.

			rm -r *
		The above code will remove all the directories in the current directory.
		So, the above can be dangerous if used in wrong directory as it can delete the files
		that can affect the working of the system.

			rm -ri *
		The above code is the interactive version of the previous code, in which it will ask
		to us for every file and folder to confirm that, we really want to delete that file
		or folder or not.


rmdir Command
	- It removes only the empty directories.
