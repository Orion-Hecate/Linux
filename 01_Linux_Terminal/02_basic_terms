Command and Shell
	- The commands are just text having some particular functionality for
	its interpreteer, but when we press enter the meaning of that text is
	interpreted by a computer program called shell.

Terminal
	- It is a platform or middle-piece on which we can type the command
	which then gets forwarded to the shell for interpretation and the
	result returned from the shell gets shown in the terminal.

There are different kinds of shell - Bash shell being the most common one of
them.

Commands are case-sensitive.
