Manual is implemented using man command

man vs help vs info
	- man is a system-wide documentation system thatprovides short reference
	manuals (pages) for individual commands. API functions, concepts,
	configuration file syntax, file formats organized in section. That's
	traditional Unix documentation system.


	- help is a built-in command in the bash shell (and that shell only)
	that documents some of the built-in commands and keywords of that shell.
	
	That's an internal documentation system of that shell.
	
	Some built-in commands do not have a manual page, so information about
	that can be get using help command.
	
	We can know which all commands have the help page, by simply running
	the help commmand alone.

	It also provides description about the loops and other workings of the
	shell if run alone.


	- info is another documentation system originating in the GNU project.
	It's hypertext with links (predates the web). An info manual is like a
	digital book with a concept of table of contents and (searchable) index
	which helps locating the information.
