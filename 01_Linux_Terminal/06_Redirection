Redirection
	- It is about changing the default flow location of the Standard data stream.
	- In the Standard data stream, we can redirect the standard input stream by
	using stream-0, standard output stream by using stream-1 and standard error
	stream using stream-2.



cat command
	- cat, by default takes the input from the terminal and gives the output to
	the terminal.

	- we can change the flow location of standard output to a file using the
	following command.
		cat 1> output.txt
		cat 1>output.txt
		cat > output.txt
		cat >output.txt
	In all the mentioned ways we can directly save the input typed in the
	terminal in the file output.txt instead of showing at the terminal.
	Writing 1 before > is optional as by default the stream-1 is selected.
	Also, there cannot be a space between 1 and >.

	- By default, this redirection, truncates the already written text in the
	file. For Appending the data, we can use the following command.
		cat 1>> output.txt
		cat >> output.txt

	- we can also change the flow loation of standard error to a file using
	the following command.
		cat [-k yo] 2> error.txt
		cat [-k yo] 2>> error.xt
	In this case typing 2 is compulsory to denote the stream for standard
	error. This methodology of recording error is usually come in handy to
	keep track as a log file.

	- Also we can simultaneously redirect both the stream-1 and stream-2
	using the following command.
		cat 1>> output.txt 2>> error.txt

	- Now for redirecting the input stream we can sue the following command.
		cat 0< input.txt
		cat < input.txt
		cat input.txt
	By default and the only value of stream available is 0, so writing 0 is
	not necessary. For input we use < operator before the file we want to
	take the input from. In above example we get output on the terminal as
	default standard output stream is terminal.
	Also without redirecting the input stream we can give the input using
	command line argument as well.

	- So combining, what we know from above, the following command takes the
	input from the input.txt and append it in the output.txt and any error
	occured in betweem will be appended to the error.txt
		cat < input.txt >> output.txt 2>> error.txt
	
	- You can also redirect the output to another terminal window by first
	getting the location of the file of that terminal using the tty command
	and then putting that path in output path of the statement.
		cat < input.txt >> /devs/pts/1
