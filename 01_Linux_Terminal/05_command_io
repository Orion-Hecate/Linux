Command Input and Output
	- There are two ways a command can take input and two way a command can
	give output.


				 _______________
Standard input (0) - - - - - -> |		| - - - - -> Standard output (1)

Command				|		|

arguments			|_______________|


Key:
- - - ->    Standard Data Stream (0, 1, 2)
------->    Not a Data Stream



The Standard output is given when the command is run successfully and the Standard
error is given when the command deals with an unwanted situation and thus cannot
continue its desired functionality.
Both Standard output and Standard error connects to the Standard Data Stream which
by default flows to the terminal. 
This flow however can be changed so that the data from one command flows directly
into the other command, this concept of chaining the commands is called Piping.
The flow can also be redirected towards the files rather than the default termianl
and is called Redirecting.

The Standard input is the input given to any command using the Standard Data Stream
which by default is connected to the terminal.
This flow of input however can also be changed using Pipelining.
Though not all commands accept the Standard input.

Command line arguments are the inputs that are feeded in the command directly using
the command line.
These arguments are more of a input that are to be given explicitly and thus concept
of Pipelining is not applied on them.
Almost all of the commands accept Command line arguments.
