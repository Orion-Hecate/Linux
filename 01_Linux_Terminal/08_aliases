Aliases
	- It is the alternate name given to some context or in this case
	commands.

	- It is useful when we want to use some long piped commands frequently,
	so we can give them an alias name that is easy to remember and can
	directly call it.

	- For this, first we can create an .bash_aliases file in which we will
	store our piped commands for whom we want to create aliases.
